This is a Flight Search App that will be able to allow the user to search for flights based on the name of the airport the user is using to entering. 
For example the user is looking for a flights from JFK -> MCO ( Queens,New York to Orlando, Florida) The user can add the depart and arrival airports into the forms and get the results on submitting the form. The results the page will be on a separate page or view in which each available flights will be render on that page. Each flight result will have a clickable link that will navigate the user to the DETAILS view page that will give the user more information about the flight.

Since this app was originally used for my POC for a similar solution and was integrated with Microservices sending all the necessary data. I would like to mimic that information with fake data. 

This means that the backend application can be in whatever you desire as long as the application can eventually create examples of microservices.
